                            <p>This recipe yielded a big “kawa,” we had plenty of leftovers in the fridge to enjoy for days!</p>

                <h2>Cooking tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I use boneless, skinless chicken thigh or leg meat for ease of prep. Chicken breast works, too, but tends to cook and dry out faster so adjust cook time accordingly.</li>
                    <li>Cut the meat and other ingredients in uniform size to ensure even cooking.</li>
                    <li>For additional color and nutrition, add one cup of green peas or garbanzo beans during the last 10 minutes of cook time.</li>
                    <li>Want more sweet and tangy flavors? Add one cup of pineapple tidbits!</li>
                </ul>

                        <h2>How to serve</h2>
                        <ul>
                            
                         
                            <P></P>
                              
                            <li>With steamed rice, of course! We also like to enjoy it at home with warm pandesal; that rich, thick tomato gravy is just made for sopping!</li>
                            <li>Got plenty of leftovers? Like giniling na baboy, this hearty chicken stew is delicious as filling for torta or omelet.</li>
                            <li>To store for future meals, allow to cool completely and transfer in resealable bags or airtight container. It should keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months.</li>
