                <h2>What is Dinakdakan</h2>
                <p>Dinakdakan or warek-warek is an Ilocano delicacy made with grilled pork parts such as the face, ears, liver, and tongue. It’s traditionally served as a bar chow or pulutan to go with ice-cold beer but has evolved over the years into a hearty main dish enjoyed with piping-hot steamed rice.</p>
                <P>Similar to the Kapampangan sisig, the meat is first simmered in aromatics until tender, charred over hot coals, and cut into bite-sized strips before tossing in tangy calamansi or vinegar dressing with minced ginger, red onions, and chili peppers.</P>
                <P>What sets this Ilocano delicacy apart from sisig is the addition of pig brain. It’s simmered until cooked, mashed until smooth, and then stirred in as a final touch to add creaminess.</P>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a bowl, combine minced pork lung (or bopis mix), vinegar, and salt. Marinate for about 10  minutes.</li>
                    <li>In a wide skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions and garlic and cook until softened.</li>
                    <li>Add fish sauce.</li>
                    <li>Add minced pork lungs and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 20 to 30 minutes or until liquid is mostly absorbed and meat begins to sizzle.</li>
                    <li>Add carrots, bell peppers, and chili peppers. Continue to cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until vegetables are tender-crisp.</li>
                </ul>

                        <h2>How to store</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <P>To store, transfer to a container with a lid and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Check for quality as the dish can go bad quicker than most foods. Cooking the meat twice and chopping it into small pieces can increase the risk for spoilage due to swings in food temperature and possible contamination from handling.</P>
