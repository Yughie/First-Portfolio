                <p>As a Chef..and working with/ (feeding them as well )various nationalities worldwide…Filipino Dishes are really authentic and very tasteful. We need not really have to be in the top most 10 list but…for them to savour these dishes of ours is magical (to them and) us (Chefs/Cook) as the person who execute them.</p>

                <p>The dishes were heaped into plain white bowls instead of spread out on a fancy serving platter, and the portions the owner suggested were perfect for two people. You could just tell that the vibrant flavors all came from the seasoning and fresh ingredients, not MSG or grease.<br><br>
                    The food was all new to me yet reminded me of home cookin', like the unique and novel tastes were somehow familiar. It was so satisfying in more ways than I expected. I would eat here every other day if it weren't so far from where I live.
