                <h2>Helpful tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do NOT use ube halaya. I had an unopened bottle in my pantry, and I thought I’d skip the extra work of preparing purple yam by using it instead. Big mistake as the ice cream had the rich, silky texture I was looking for but was way too sweet for my taste.</li>
                    <li>Rinse and drain the macapuno preserves well as they’re usually packed in heavy syrup which can make the ice cream super sweet.</li>
                    <li>I was fortunate to find fresh ube on one of my trips to Seafood City, and I just boiled and mashed about one cup worth of the tubers to use in this ice cream. If you’re in the U.S. and have only access to the frozen (already cooked and grated) yam sold in packages, make sure to squeeze it dry as the excess liquid will cause ice crystals in the ice cream.</li>
                    <li>Do NOT skip the ube extract as not only does it heightens color, but it also deepens the flavor.</li>
                    <li>Heavy cream is the foundation of no-churn ice creams, but you can swap it with an equal amount of coconut cream (first extraction or kakang gata) if you want a vegan treat. You can also use Nestle’s all-purpose cream.</li>
                    <li>For optimum volume, have all the ingredients very cold.</li>
                    
                </ul>

                        <P>Cover the container with plastic film, gently pressing it on the surface of the whipped cream to prevent ice crystals.</P>

                    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 cups heavy cream, very cold</li>
                        <li>1 can (14 ounces) condensed milk, chilled</li>
                        <li>1 cup ube, cooked, mashed and chilled</li>
                        <li>3 drops ube extract</li>
                        <li>1 cup macapuno strips, rinsed and drained well</li>
                    </ul> 
                   
                    
                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large bowl, combine heavy cream, condensed milk, and mashed ube. Using a hand mixer at low speed, beat mixture until it begins to thicken.</li>
                        <li>Increase speed to medium and continue to beat for about 8 to 10 minutes or until stiff peaks form.</li>
                        <li>While beating, squeeze a few drops of ube extract until the desired color is achieved.</li>
                        <li>Add macapuno strips and gently fold in to distribute, making sure not to deflate the cream mixture.</li>
                        <li>Transfer mixture into a 9 x 5 loaf pan. Cover with plastic film, lightly pressing the film on the surface of the cream mixture.</li>
                        <li>Freeze for at least 6 hours or overnight. Serve frozen.</li>
                        
                    </ol>
                   
                    <h2>Notes</h2>
                    <p>For optimal volume, make sure all the ingredients are very cold.</p>
