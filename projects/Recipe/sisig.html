                            <P>Sizzling Sisig makes a great party appetizer as well as a hearty dinner entree. A delicious combination of juicy pork and tangy, savory, and spicy flavors, it’s seriously addictive! <br><br> Sizzling sisig is a Kapampangan delicacy usually served as an appetizer but has evolved over the years into a popular dinner entree. Although traditionally made with grilled pig face and ears, different adaptations using flaked fish, seafood, tofu, and other cuts of meat such as chicken and crispy lechon kawali are also common.</P>

                        <h2>How to make sisig</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <P>To make this appetizer, the pork is first boiled until tender and then grilled on a hot grill or quickly blanched in hot oil until lightly crisp. The meat is then finely chopped and tossed together with diced onions, chili peppers, calamansi juice, and seasonings.</P>
                            <p>Some recipes add mayonnaise to the pork mixture for a touch of creaminess, but it’s not traditional in the Kapampangan version. I usually skip it as sisig with mayo tends to spoil faster and do not reheat well.</p>
                            <p>Chicken liver is also a classic ingredient in this spicy appetizer. The organ meat is usually grilled and chopped finely before mixing with the pork, but my aunt who happens to make the meanest sisig on the planet taught me a secret that’s easier and tastier. Liver spread!</p>

                <h2>How to store</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>To store leftovers, transfer in a container with a tight-fitting lid and keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months.</li>
                    <li>To reheat, thaw in the refrigerator overnight if frozen. Place in a single layer on a wide pan and gently cook, turning as needed, to an internal temperature of 165 F. Alternatively, warm up in the microwave in 2 to 3-minute intervals until heated through.</li>

                        <h2>How to serve</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As its name implies, sisig is usually served on sizzling metal plates to help retain heat. Just preheat the plates in the oven or on the stovetop a few minutes before serving. You can buy these special plates at most houseware stores or online for convenient delivery.</li>
                            <li>While it is mostly served as a viand, adobo meat is also used as filling for bread such as siopao or pandesal.</li>

                        <li>1 tablespoon Liquid seasoning</li>

                        <li>pepper to taste</li>

                    </ul>
                  
                    
                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large pot, combine pig face, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, about 1 tablespoon salt,  and enough water to completely cover pork. </li>
                        <li>Bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top. Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 50 minutes to 1 hour or until meat is tender. Remove from heat and drain well, discarding liquid.</li>
                        <li>Over a hot grill, grill pork for about 7 to 10 minutes on each side or until crisp and slightly charred. Or arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet and broil in a 450 F oven for about 4 to 5 minutes or until nicely charred. </li>
                        <li>Remove from heat, allow to cool to touch, and chop meat.</li>
                        <li>In a large bowl, combine chopped meat, onions, chili peppers, calamansi juice., and liquid seasoning. </li>
                        <li>And liver spread and gently stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                        <li>To serve, transfer to sizzling hot plates. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Notes</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To serve on sizzling metal plates, preheat the plates in the oven or on the stovetop for a few minutes before serving to retain heat. Place a small pat of butter on the hot plates and carefully transfer the sisig.</li>
                        <li>For an authentic sisig experience, you can also top with sunny-side-up eggs before serving by cracking a raw egg over the mixture while it’s still sizzling hot.</li>
                        
                    </ol>
