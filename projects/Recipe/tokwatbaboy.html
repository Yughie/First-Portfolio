                            <p>This recipe yielded a big “kawa,” we had plenty of leftovers in the fridge to enjoy for days!</p>

                <h2>Preparing the pork</h2>
             
                <ul>
                    <li>Parts of the pork face such as ears and snouts are typically used for tokwa’t baboy, but you can omit it and use all pork belly.</li>
                    <li>Simmer the pork face until tender and dice into bite-size pieces. Add aromatics such as onions, garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns to infuse flavor.</li>
                    
                </ul>

                        <h2>Deep-frying tofu</h2>
                        <ul>
                            
                         
                            <P></P>
                              
                            <li>Use firm tofu, not silken or soft!</li>
                            <li>Drain the tofu well of the packing liquid.  Wrap the tofu block with a thick layer of paper towels, set it over a wire rack, and weigh it down with a saucer or bowl for about 15 to 20 minutes to extract moisture.</li>
                            <li>You can cut the block into 1-inch thick slices and cut into cubes after deep-frying or fry already cubed for crispy edges.</li>
                            <li>Deep-fry tofu in hot oil, turning as needed, until golden and crisp. Use enough oil, about 2 inches deep, to ensure the tofu is fully submerged.</li>
                            <li>Maintain the oil at 350 F to 375 F. Do not overcrowd the pan and fry in batches as needed to keep the temperature from plummeting.</li>

                    <h2>The dipping sauce</h2>
                    <p></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bring to a boil without stirring to cook off the strong acid taste.</li>
                        <li>Although other variants of escabeche can be eaten cold, this Filipino version is best enjoyed hot and fresh or at the very least at room temperature as the sauce tends to congeal as it stands. For best texture, top the fried fish with the vegetables and sauce just when ready to serve.</li>
                        <li>You can prepare the sauce in advance and refrigerate to allow the flavors to meld.</li>

                    <h2>How to serve and store</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tokwa’t baboy can be enjoyed on its own as an appetizer or main dish. It can also be served alongside lugaw (congee) as topping.</li>
                        <li>To prepare ahead of time, I suggest storing the pork and the sauce only and cook a fresh batch of tofu when ready to serve for the best texture. Keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months.</li>
                        <li>To reheat, place in a saucepan and heat to an internal temperature of 165 F. Fry the tofu and combine.</li>
                   

                    </ul>

                    <h2>For the Dipping Sauce</h2>

                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a pot over medium heat, combine pork ear, pork belly, and enough water to cover. Add onions, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and salt. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top.</li>
                        <li>Remove from heat and drain well, reserving 1/2 cup of the liquid. Allow to cool to touch and dice meat.</li>
                        <li>Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or until meat is fork-tender.  </li>
                        <li>Drain tofu from packing liquid. Wrap tofu block in paper towels and weigh down with a small plate or cup for about 15 to 20 minutes to excess moisture. </li>
                        <li>In a cast-iron skillet over high heat, heat oil until hot but not smoking. Add tofu and deep-fry, turning as necessary, until golden brown and crisp.</li>
                        <li>In a pan over medium heat, combine pork broth, vinegar, soy sauce, salt, pepper, and sugar. Bring to a boil, without stirring, for about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>With a slotted spoon, remove tofu from skillet and drain on paper towels. Cut into 1-inch cubes. </li>
                        <li>In a large bowl, combine diced pork, tofu cubes, shallots, and chili peppers. Pour vinegar dressing and gently toss to distribute.   </li>
                        <li>Transfer into a serving platter and garnish with more chopped shallots and chili peppers. </li>
